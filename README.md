Module 4 Challenge School District Analysis

Due to an issue with Thomas High 9th Grade Math and Reading scores we replaced those scores with NaNs and reran the district analysis without Thomas High School math and reading scores. Below are how  these changes affect the analysis:

•	District Summary was higher by only a tenth of a point in most places than the District Summary without Thomas High 9th Grade Math and Reading scores.
•	School Summary without Thomas High 9th Grade:
 School Summary With 9th grade:

 

•	Replacing the Thomas High 9th grad reading and Math score only resulted in changes in tenths only. With little change to other schools.
•	Math and reading score by grade: tenths of a point difference before and after the removal of 9th grade THS.
•	Schools by spending, size, and type had very little impact overall.
 

 
 

 
Summary

Math and Reading scores were slightly higher with the 9th grade data and slightly lower without the data. Overall Passing has the same results as the math and reading score with the removal of the 9th grade data. School spending per student dropped slightly with the removal of the 9th grade data. There was no change to the spending per student. But there was a slight change in the spending ranges per student.
